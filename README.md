# I teach French: a free resources website for teachers of French

As a teacher, we spend a lot of time preparing resources that are engaging for students to support teaching and learning. A good resource can make a real difference in helping students understanding concepts. However, creating resources is very time consuming for teachers who also need to prepare and deliver lessons, as well as mark students' work. 

## UX

### Project goals

I Teach French aims to provide free, easily accessible downloadable resources for teachers to use in their lessons. The search function allows users to enter key words relating to the topic they want to work on and quickly assess the nature of the resource with an image, the language skill, the level and a description in French and English, before they download it.There is a possibility to leave a donation of 5€ for users who think that they have found some value in the resources. Similar sites that exist today operate either on a subscription basis (frenchteacher.net), or they charge for resources (tes.com/teaching-resources) or they are riddled with adverts which make for an unpleasant user experience (fr.islcollective.com).

### User stories

As a user of I Teach French
* I can access a collection of free downloadable teaching resources.
* I can search the collection with keywords in French or English.
* I can visually assess the nature of the resource.
* I can download the resources in one click.
* I can create an account and receive a personalised welcome when I log in.
* I can make a donation of €5 via Stripe if I want to encourage the creation of more material.

As the owner of the site
* I can upload files to the site and share them with a community of teachers.
* I can receive donations via Stripe from users.
* I can store the resources that I have created online and easily access them when needed.

### design choices

The design makes it straightforward for users to access the main feature of the site, the resources. Once their account is created (again, a straightforward non-intrusive process, not requiring the use of personal data), they land on the home page where they have 2 options, go to the collection or donate, they can do so via the navbar or via in-text links. If they want to donate they are redirect to Stripe's checkout where they are invited to enter their card's details to donate 5€. If they go to the resources they can scroll through the bank of resources or enter key words in the search bar to quickly access resources that might be of interest, should they find something of interest they can just click on the download button. They can go back to the home page at any time by clicking on I Teach French in the bar. The bar and the resources page are responsive and display well on mobiles tablets and laptops. The color scheme is pure black and white for ease of reading and the site's background displays a photo of Paris to match with the site's target language.

CSS has been validated using [W3 CSS validator](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator).

Lightouse testing from Chrome developer's tools returned positive results with a few issues, not seeming to affect the functioning of the site.


* Functionalities:

* I can access a collection of free downloadable teaching resources.
-> all resources are visible and dowloadable
* I can search the collection with keywords in French or English.
-> different keywords testes return relevant resources

-> the images show up and give a good idea of the nature of the resource 
* I can download the resources in one click.
-> files are dowloaded when the button is clicked
* I can create an account and receive a personalised welcome when I log in.
-> Log in works well (raphaelmar3 version3 for a test user), registering seems to work now, but it took a few attempts at first to register a new user, this might be qn issue to investigate
* I can make a donation of €5 via Stripe if I want to encourage the creation of more material.
-> Payment with the stripe test card (4242...) works and redirects the user to the success page. This is the step I had most issues with but it works now.

-> I can use the admin superuser to create new products easily, when running from gitpod
* I can receive donations via Stripe from users.
